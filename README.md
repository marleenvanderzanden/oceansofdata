Can you track vessels in open sea when they switch off their tracking system? What do they do when they don't want to be found? How can people actively take part in our actions from their computer?

Are you a programmer, designer, concept developer or data-genius? Do you want to build tools, combine data, use satellites or develop creative new ideas for actions at sea? During this Hackathon we will welcome you inside our world of activism and research. We'll share our research, data sets, hardware, activism knowledge, food, drinks, beds, mentors, and more.

This will be the weekend during which you can combine your skills with others, meet enthousiast and knowledgable people and help preserve our oceans. A jury will select the best final concept. Winners will receive the budget they need to realize the project together with Greenpeace Nederland. 

Challenges:
1. How can we track vessels at open sea? Tracking vessels helps us reveal illegal activities. All seaworthy ships have a public tracking system (AIS). However, crews with shady intentions can turn it off manually. Can we use existing tools like satellites, radar or GPS to detect or predict the ships' course and reveal their dirty deeds?
2. How can our supporters actively control, manipulate or participate in live actions and be part of the experience? Create a concept for a new and exciting way to involve people even if they are living on the other side of the world.
3. Mystery challenge (with focus on research of public data)
